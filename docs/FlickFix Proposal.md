- [ ] Problem Statement :bulb:
- Ideally, a video editing program is both user-friendly and intuitive, perfect for anyone who wants to create video projects. Unfortunately, many existing video editing programs are both cumbersome and unintuitive, making it difficult for casual users to make simple edits to their video clips. This is a problem for people such as educators or content-creators, who need to edit video recordings as part of their job. The proposed solution to this problem is to develop a simplified video editing software program with a user-friendly interface, streamlined features, and easy accessibility for casual users. This solution benefits the people who are not video editing enthusiasts, but who want to make easy edits to their video clips without having to spend time learning complex software. In summary, the problem of complex and cumbersome video editing software can be solved by developing software that is more accessible to a wider range of users by simplifying the video editing process, making it less time-consuming and more enjoyable for everyone.

- [ ] Project Description :memo:
- This project will be a free video editing desktop application that focuses on simplicity and usability. Users will have access to a number of common features such as video trimming, intro and outro creation, and audio dubbing, all contained in a user-friendly GUI.

- [ ] Proposed Implementation Language(s) :octocat:
- This project was implemented using C++.

- [ ] Libraries, Packages, Development Kits, etc. to be used in in the proposed implementation languages(s) :wrench:
- I used Qt Creator 5.15.2 as a framework to build my desktop application with FFmpeg as a multimedia processing library.

- [ ] Additional Software/Equipment Needed :computer::joystick:
- The only equipment needed is a PC running Windows 10. In addition to FFmpeg, the K-Lite Basic Codec Pack is necessary to run the application.

- [ ] Personal Motivation :cake:  
- This project is highly motivated by my personal experiences with the issues described in my problem statement. As a result, I have a strong interest in using this application myself. Additionally, this project presents a significant opportunity for me to expand my knowledge and experience in the field of computer science. By utilizing new frameworks to build my most complex program yet, I will gain valuable skills and insights that will benefit me both personally and professionally.

- [ ] Outline of Future Research Efforts :books::rocket:  
- I plan to complete the project in steps, starting with research that will include using resources such as YouTube to learn how to use the Qt framework and W3 Schools to brush up on C++ and Python. Next, I will finalize the design using mockups and prototypes. After that, the efforts to build the application will begin until it is finished. Finally, I will do thorough testing both during and after development.

- [ ] Schedule :calendar: :watch:  
- The scheduled plan is to complete this project over the summer and have it finished by the fall semester. Below is a proposed schedule based on my outline of future research efforts.
	- Week 1 (5/6-5/13): Research frameworks and get a preliminary feel for the scope of the project. 
	- Week 2 (5/13-5/20): Write the test plan.
	- Weeks 3-4 (5/20-6/3): Create mockups then build GUI.
	- Weeks 5-8 (6/3-7/1): Implement app features.
	- Weeks 9-10 (7/1-7/15): Do thorough testing.
	- Weeks 11-12 (7/15-7/29): Finalize project for delivery.
